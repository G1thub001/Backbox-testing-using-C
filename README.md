For this project, you will design and implement a Map-Reduce based WordCount
application, which will receive one or more directoryPaths as map commands, and will
find the number of occurrences of each word existing in all files located in specified
directories. You will write two programs: a mapper and a reducer, which will
communicate using message queues. This project will enable you to practice with
multiple topics that you have learned so far in this course, including message queues,
semaphores, child creation, and multi-threading.
